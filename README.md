        <h1>A Little About Me: Dylan</h1>
        <p> I am triple majoring in Journalism, Political Science, and International Affairs. I previously attended SJDC in Stockton where I was feature editor and editor-in-chief for The Collegian. My goal is to get into a dual degree program for International Law and International Relations in Madrid, and am currently studying for the LSAT for admissions requirement; as well as trying to find time to study Spanish, though I know I need to study German for a class.</p>
        <p>I have two cats, Ricky and Elphie and one dog, Jack (who lives with my parents in California), as well as, my roomate has one cat, Prismo, and a jumping spider who she just adopted, Penelope. I am heavily considering addopting a gecko or a skink, and my roomate is not being helpful by encouraging this idea.</p>

        <p>I am a bit of a language nerd and have studied over 25 languages in my life. However, I am monolingual still. I tend to get distracted by the idea of another language and then forget all of the basics of the language I was previously studying when I begin another. I try to limit myself to studying only 2 languages at a time, however this rarely happens, now is an example of that.</p>
        <h3>Languages I am Currently Studying (with links to my current favorite songs in those languages)</h3>
